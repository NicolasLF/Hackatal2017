I had no idea what to expect, but thankfully, I discovered Jeanne`s apartment for my first experience. I am so glad I did! Jeanne and her staff were very kind, inviting and reasonable, the apartment itself was very comfortable, with all the utilities I could possibly need, and the location (in the heart of Le Marais) is simply unbeatable. My bedroom was spacious and I got a great night of sleep each night, was able to enter and exit whenever I pleased without disturbing others, and had access to all kinds of restaurants, metro lines and La Seine (my new favorite running path!) just a moment`s walk away. I cannot recommend this apartment enough and would plan on returning on my next trip to Paris. This stay not only made my trip to Paris special, but it also gave me confidence in airbnb for all my future travels.\n+ Plus",

Our room even had two huge maps of Paris that made it a great home base for sightseeing.

I wasn't able to meet Jeanne as she was away for vacation, but she arranged for someone to meet me at the apartment to give me a tour, and her sister checked up on me periodically to make sure everything was going well. The apartment is situated in the perfect location, nearby a few metro stops, surrounded by plenty of adorable shops and restaurants in the Marais, and within walking distance to many museums and landmarks. The neighborhood seemed very safe (and Paris' streets are known for being well lit!), and I walked around alone after midnight a few times without feeling threatened. The room itself is very spacious and comfortable, and gets plenty of light from the window. You can hang up your clothes and really feel like you moved in! The apartment is well equipped with cooking supplies and the main living area is pleasant. There are also shopping bags and umbrellas and other useful amenities that I appreciated. Some minor things to note: two other rooms in the apartment are also listed on Airbnb, so you may be staying with two rooms of strangers. I was very nervous as a single female traveler, but my housemates were really considerate and nice! Also the room had a weird smell that never quite went away (I think from the previous guests) and the construction going on right outside the window started every morning at 8. I still had a great time!\n+ Plus",

And even though she couldn't welcome me on her own Anna the lady she engaged to overtake her part was extremely friendly and helpful. But the way Jeanne was taking care for me was unbelievable. We ended up in her dance club where i got to learn Forro and the wonderful music from Brazil and got introduced to a bunch of lovely people, Jeanne's friends.

It was my first time using Airbnb and I was quite nervous but Jeanne & her home made me feel instantly at ease. She sent me a detailed description of how to get from the airport to her house. It was so nice and helpful, It made me feel like I wasn't along in Paris and I could even bother her with non-house related questions:) She was so nice and considerate. She showed me my room and explained to me things about the apartment. How to use the washing machine, how to make coffee :) She is so generous with her things. She knew I liked to cook so she showed me her spices and oils, etc. She had also written out events happening in Paris during my stay, and drew a map of grocery stores near by. There is wireless internet that worked great! She even bought me a croissant! Delish! The house was outstanding. So centrally located. 2 blocks from the pompidou center. But It was also very quiet, must be because it is so high up. It was clean and tidy, but also homely, and had a great smell! The light is beautiful in her house. She left for work soon after I arrived and then was heading back to the countryside where she spends most of her time. So I only met her once. But she emailed me to check to see that everything was going well. There are two showers that were great. I could even take a bath if I wanted. I loved my mornings there most of all. I opened the big window in the front room and I could hear the streets of Paris down below while enjoying my morning coffee. The bed was very comfortable. I rented the double bedroom. I hope to stay here again if I will visit paris and I recommend her place to anyone.\n+ Plus",

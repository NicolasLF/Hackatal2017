We were three adults and I'd say four would be pushing it! Probably perfect for two. The water heater is small, so spreading out showers is a good idea and if you want to do laundry, have a translator on hand if you don't speak French :) Overall a lovely stay and a good workout walking up to the flat!",

The bed is very confortable, the wifi is powerful... we had a wonderful time at Alexandre's place. The neighborhood is exciting: full of restaurants, coffee places, the Centre Pompidou, mini markets and a few feet of subway's station. We recommend 100% this apartment in the Paris's historic Marais.",

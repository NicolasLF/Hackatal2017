In amazing condition, spotlessly clean and the period details are just stunning. Our room was a nice size, very clean and had coffee/tea making facilities and we also had a private bathroom/shower and shared the main WC. As i said, the two days we were there the buzz and noise of Paris was huge, yet the bedroom is set back from the street looking onto an open atrium, our windows were open and the room was very quiet. Francks apartment is a rare fine, just truly amazing and we'll stay there again next time we are in Paris.

My room was divine, I absolutely loved the light filled room and the beautiful palette of colour (URL HIDDEN) was very calming and a relaxing room to spend time in, I also had my own bathroom, which was really lovely, again I found it really clean and the large shower head was a bonus. Franck was really helpful with places to go and visit and with directions, and food places, he's very easy going and very friendly. The location of the apartment was Fantastic!!!!It's close to supermarkets, transport links and a great place to base from to travel around Paris! I loved staying at Franck's, I would definitely return on my next visit to Paris, I felt very safe staying at Franck's, I felt like I was visiting a friend. On my last day as I was leaving Franck gave me one of his Metro tickets to catch the train back to the station ( which took 16 minutes to (Gard de Nord) as I was running to late to walk to the station, trying to fit everything in... I just felt that was such a nice thing to do! Thank you Franck, I will definitely be back on my return!\n+ Plus",

He made sure we felt very comfortable and kept the house very clean. The house looks even better than the pictures, it's your typical french house in the middle of the city with everything right at your doorstep.

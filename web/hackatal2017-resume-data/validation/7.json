Without a door bell or ability to be buzzed in from the entrance, you have to wait for her to come get you. We eventually did get inside the apartment complex after a neighbor let us in and a kind man called her using his phone. Without any knowledge on what floor level or apartment number she lives in, as it it wasn't provided in the directions, it was confusing. However, Anna was waiting for us too and was equally confused as to how we got into the actual complex. Perhaps this can be avoided by providing the apartment complex's main entrance with the directory and security codes so guests can buzz themselves inside. Anna was very kind and hospitable when we arrived. She offered us sparkling water and sweets. The apartment is very clean, roomy, and has a very nice bedroom for guests. We enjoyed talking to Anna and she has a loving and animated personality. Her apartment is perfectly located so that guests can travel Paris very easily, being that the metro is truly across the street.

Her flat overlooks a river and so you can see from bedroom, a very relaxing sight. Her entire home is very cozy and she let us use her kitchen equipment and many others. She has wifi which was helpful to us. But the most important for us is that is Anna very warm and friendly. She treated us like a dear friend staying in her home. She is very approachable and will readily answered all our questions. She patiently showed us instruction on how go to around Paris on our own just like a local. She even prepared coffee, tea and toasts for us for dessert. We will surely come back to her when we visit Paris again in the future. Thank you so much Anna!",

This is my first time in Paris, Anna is a perfect host for you in France. She speaks fluent English( I worried about language in France), very nice, helpful and informative. She walked me out to show me the way to the train and even offered to take my luggage up the stairs when I first arrived, and wrote me many notes before I went out. And about the room. It's very tidy, comfortable , the view is very good, and the location is very convenient(1 min walk from the train station, you can check it from the (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) map). And some friendly reminders: 1. Anna's flat is at 4th floor and you have to go there by staircase. 2. If you come back at night, the light system was not very user friendly, make sure you ask Anna how does it work before you go out. Hope that comment give you some reference about Anna's flat",

L’empathie de cette première rencontre a été déterminante. Thierry est aimable, cultivé et à une personnalité secrète. À vous de la découvrir au fil des conversations : un soir, nous avons parlé jusqu’à 4 heures du matin. Un resto à ne pas manquer: la Brasserie Flo. Merci Thierry. La richesse du 10e arrondissement réside dans sa mixité sociale. Allez voir La Porte St-Denis (seulement 25 minutes de marche jusqu’à la rue Rivoli, 1er arrondissement) et La Porte St-Martin. De la rue Martel aux sites touristiques les plus importants, vous pouvez tout faire à pied lorsqu’il fait beau. 13 jours à Paris chez Thierry a été d’une trop courte durée.

He is a perfect host and his house is indescribable, but i will try it, It makes you feel like home, it has a antique air but modern at the same time, it's really pretty. The house is next to two metro station but you can walk to the center too (as we did every day) and next to Gare du Nord and Gare l'Est. It has a couple of supermarkets next to it so you can buy some food and cooked it at home. Thierry is a very nice person that picked us up at the railstation and got us home, there he explained us all that we needed to know about Paris. I totally recommend it!!\n+ Plus",

Overall, it is very nice authentic place with modern improvements for top comfort. Thierry is a very nice guy talking very good English so can be asked for tips and hints. Great value for price!",

Thierry was a fantastic host and provided us with really useful maps and invited us to help ourselves to drinks etc. We felt very welcome.

Not only is it spotless (I've never seen such a clean place!), it is decorated with impeccable taste: an elegant and soothing combination of old world charm and modern design with all the amenities . Comfortable bed in a nice room. Thierry even took care of closing the exterior shutters for us while we were out so when we came in late at night, we didn't have to worry about closing them ourselves. The apartment is on the 3rd floor (with elevator) , with a nice view of parisian roof tops, Note: windows are street-side, so bring earplugs if you are a light sleeper - Paris is a busy city! I only wish we could have stayed longer to fully take advantage of Thierry's hospitality and wonderful home. Un très grand merci, Thierry!\n+ Plus",

Also, owner provides bottle of water and little madeline for the welcome. However, the only down side of this place is that there is no lift or elevator as the building is old. However, it doesn't effect much to us. We consider climbing up stairs as an exercise. Also the host answers and provide all information really quick. We like this place and will definitely recommend our friends.\n+ Plus",

The location was the best part, it was close to everything with a lot of cute creperies and restaurants within walking distance and you could actually see the Eiffeltower from the window. Although the neighborhood was lively, the windows were well soundproofed which made our nightsleep very pleasant. Furthermore, the baathroom was very fresh, a small but functional kitchen if you want to cook your dinner by yourself. During our weekend, François et Veronique continually checked that we were having a good time and that we were welcome to ask them anything that we wanted. We gladly recommend you to visit this cute apartment and enjoy a few days in Paris.\n+ Plus",

I can't say enough about how helpful they were! The place is exactly how it looks on the pictures, very comfortable and cozy. It had everything you need for an amazing stay in Paris (they provided coffee, water, soaps, etc). There are stores on the street if you want to stock the kitchen. The location is absolutely perfect and the decoration is amazing. Kitchen and bathroom are beautiful as well and spotlessly clean as all the apartment. The bed is very comfortable. It's a perfect place for two or three people (there is a kingsize bed and a pull-out bed for a further person). Very central and on a quiet street because there are no cars, only people walking around. You get a nice feeling for real Parisian life and you are able to walk to most everything you'll want to see. Very nice restaurants, bars and cafés are around. Furthermore the Saint-Germain area is one of the most beautiful in Paris. You can't find a better place! We loved it! Thanks a lot!\n+ Plus",
